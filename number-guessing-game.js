// Generate a random number between 1 and 100. Using the browser functions prompt and alert, 
// ask the user to guess the number. You should give them 4 tries to guess the number. 
// If they guess wrong, tell them if it's higher or lower. If they guess right, congratulate them.
// Otherwise, give them a message saying what the correct number was, as well as their list of guesses.

// Create a file called number-guessing-game.js.
// In this file, re-write your number guessing game 
// (from the basic javascript workshop) for the command line!
// Instead of using prompt and alert, you will have to use 
// capabilities from NodeJS and any external module. 
// HINT: there is an npm library called prompt that can help you with that :)
// Save/commit/push
